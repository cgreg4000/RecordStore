**Purpose**

This is a project I started created at the end of the C#/ASP.NET track in my time at Coding Dojo. It is a fictitious online vinyl record store where users can view records, play samples and register to "buy" records.

**Some Highlights**

● Built using C# as the primary language on ASP.Net Core framework utilizing Entity Framework Core to work with a MySQL database.

● App features CRUD commands when logged in as an administrator allowing you to add, view, update and delete records. Try it out using - email: admin@recordstore, password: recordstore

● Features login and registration capabilities with user authentication utilizing Bcrypt and validations.
